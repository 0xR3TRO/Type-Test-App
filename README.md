## Project Description

### Objective:

The "Type Test App" project aims to provide users with a tool to measure typing speed and keystroke count. The application allows users to track their typing performance, which can be used for self-improvement, typing speed training, and efficiency analysis.

### Feature Description:

- **Time Measurement:** Users can measure the time taken to type a given text.
- **Keystroke Counter:** The app records the number of keystrokes during typing.
- **Test Customization:** Ability to choose the length and difficulty of the test text.
- **Results History:** Storing and viewing previous test results.
- **Sharing Results:** Option to share results on social media platforms or export them to a file.

## Requirements Analysis:

### Functional Requirements:

- **Time Measurement:** Users can measure the time taken to type a selected text.
- **Keystroke Counter:** The app records the number of keystrokes and displays the result after the test.
- **Test Customization:** Ability to choose different test texts and their difficulty levels.
- **Results History:** The app stores the user's test results with options for viewing and analysis.
- **Sharing Results:** Users can share their results or export them to a file.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

- **Measurement Accuracy:** The app must accurately measure the time and number of keystrokes.
- **Performance:** The app should run smoothly and without delays.
- **User Interface:** A user-friendly and intuitive interface that is easy to use.

## Interface Design:

### Sketches/Visualizations of the Interface:

- _Home Page:_ Control panel with options to start the test, access results history, and customize test settings.
- _Test Window:_ Area for typing the text, timer, and keystroke counter.
- _Results History:_ Viewing and analyzing previous results.

  - Options to share and export

## System Architecture:

### Data Structure Description:

The application stores typing test data, including:

- **Test Parameters:** Information about the selected text and difficulty level.
- **Results:** Stored data on typing time, keystroke count, and test date.

### Architecture Diagrams:

The architecture is based on the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern, where:

- **Model:** Handles the logic for measurement and data management.
- **View:** Presents the user interface.
- **Controller:** Manages communication between the model and view.

## Implementation:

### Technology Description:

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React.js).
- **Backend:** Flask (Python).
- **Database:** SQLite (storing test and result data).

### Code Structure:

- _Directories/Files_: Separate files for measurement logic, interface, and data management.
- _Coding Style_: Use of modularity, readability, and comments in the code.

## Testing:

### Test Plan:

- **Unit Tests:** Verify the correctness of timing and keystroke counting functions.
- **Integration Tests:** Ensure components work correctly together.
- **User Interface Tests:** Test user interactions on various devices.
- **Performance Tests:** Evaluate the app's performance during different typing tests.

### Testing Procedures:

- Develop a set of test cases for each app function.
- Establish procedures for reporting and fixing identified bugs.

## Deployment and Maintenance:

### Deployment Plan:

- **Deployment Stages:** Testing, bug fixing, and publication on platforms accessible to users.
- **Timeline:** Set dates for planned stages.

### Maintenance Procedures:

- **Technical Support:** Establish communication channels for users to report issues.
- **Updates:** Plan regular updates based on user feedback and needs.

## Schedule:

### Project Plan:

- **Project Phases:** Divide work into specific tasks (e.g., implementing the timer, interface, testing).
- **Timeline:** Determine the time required for each phase.

## Budget:

### Estimated Costs:

- **Application Development:** Based on hours worked or the development team.
- **Maintenance Costs:** Servers, potential fees for external services, technical support.
